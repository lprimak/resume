// tag::warpsolutions[]
! 1999-2002 ! *President & Chief Technology Officer* +
WARP Solutions, Inc

- Managed a development team of 40 people, including teams in the USA, Russia and India.
- Invented, Designed & Developed the Patented WARP Load Balancer application, including Kernel-level, TCP/IP driver needed to intercept requests and redirect them to the least loaded server. The kernel driver is multi-threaded, common-code multi-platform driver that runs on Linux, Windows, and MacOS X.
- The WARP Load Balancer is the only one in the industry that is completely peer-to-peer, where the decisions are distributed to all nodes, with no central load balancer device, allowing unparalleled scalability. WARP Load Balancer is written using C++ and Java/Swing GUI.
- Designed & Architected the WARP Content Distributor, which has the ability to distribute content to a server cluster, and communicate with the WARP Load Balancer in real-time to atomically "switch over" to the new content. WARP Content Distributor is written in C++, with a Java/Swing GUI and J2EE back-end.
- Invented & Architected the Distributed Database Transaction Clusters, similar in features to the Oracle Real Application Clusters, but using a different approach that drops the requirement for Database Vendor Support.
